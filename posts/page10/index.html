          </a>
          
          <p>Navigation lights are used in real aircrafts to signal their presence and give information about position and orientation, especially when fog is present or in night time. Red light identifies the left side of the aircraft, while green light is for the left one. The white light identifies the rear.</p>

<p>This is why in this article we are going to take a look at <a href="https://www.banggood.com/URUAV-SL03-Wireless-Night-Flight-LED-Flash-Light-Built-in-85mAh-LiPo-Battery-For-RC-Airplane-FPV-Racer-Drone-p-1710288.html?p=CA03112038011201508Q">URUAV SL03 Wireless Navigation Lights</a>, i.e. navigation lights designed for RC aircrafts.</p>

          </a>
          
          <p>Every vehicle that is remotely controlled can be called drone, even if this term is often used when referring to quadrotors. In this article we are going to take a look at a drone that is a 1600mm wingspan RC glider plane: <a href="https://www.banggood.com/VolantexRC-Ranger-1600-V757-7-1600mm-Wingspan-EPO-FPV-Aircraft-RC-Airplane-PNP-p-1140479.html?p=CA03112038011201508Q">Volantex Ranger 1600 V757-7</a>. The term Ranger is really appropriate since this aircraft can be used to monitor the surroundings from the sky due to its flying capabilities.</p>

<p>In fact, this aircraft is arranged to be equipped with optional FPV rig (camera, VTX and antenna) so as to be used for FPV flights. There are two versions: KIT (no electronics) and PNP (everything included except for TX, RX and battery).</p>

          </a>
          
          <p>HD action cameras are becoming smaller and able to record higher quality footage not only because of the equipped sensor but also due to the addition of video stabilization systems. The fact that they are more and more lighter is a crucial feature since weights is one of the most important characteristics for drones: weight impacts on flight times and flight regulations, like EASA rules in Europe (you do not need an EASA pilot certificate to fly if the drone is under 250g and there are not also other limitations like the ones you have to respect when flying in A3 Open category).</p>

<p>In this article we are going to take a look at the <a href="https://www.banggood.com/Caddx-Peanut-Action-Camera-Wifi-2_5k-30min-Recording-27g-Magnetic-Charging-FPV-Sport-Camera-for-RC-Drone-p-1897239.html?p=CA03112038011201508Q">Caddx Peanut HD stabilized drone action camera</a>: this camera is the result from the collaboration of CaddxFPV and Insta360 (manufactured by Insta360). In fact, the Caddx Peanut is basically an Insta360 Go 2 made for FPV, meaning it has some features that make it perfect for recording flying footage.</p>

          </a>
          
          <p>FPV Goggles are one of the most important element when flying freestyle/racing quadcopters in first person view: the quality of the image received from the quadcopter is one of the critical factors determining how well the pilot will react and command the aircraft in the desired direction.<br />
Even if digital FPV systems are getting more affordable, the majority of FPV pilots are still using analog systems: one of the reasons is the feeling given by analog systems, but there is also the cost factor since on board digital transmission systems are still too expensive compared to analog ones.</p>

<p>This is why in this article we are going to take a look at the <a href="https://www.banggood.com/SKYZONE-SKY04X-V2-OLED-5_8GHz-48CH-Steadyview-Receiver-1280X960-Display-FPV-Goggles-Support-DVR-With-Head-Tracker-Fan-For-RC-Racing-Drone-p-1755006.html?p=CA03112038011201508Q">Skyzone SKY04X OLED FPV Goggles</a>, which are probably the best product for viewing and receiving FPV video feed using analog systems. We are also going to compare some of Skyzone SKY04X features with FatShark HDO 2.</p>

          </a>
          
          <p>Drone pilots know how much is important to have a good battery charger, especially when dealing with lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries: in fact, managing LiPo batteries is a task that needs a good amount of attention considering how they can become dangerous if this is not done correctly.</p>

<p>This is why in this article we are going to analyze the <a href="https://www.banggood.com/HOTA-D6-Pro-AC-200W-DC-650W-15A+2-Dual-Channel-Lipo-Charger-With-Wireless-Charging-for-NiZn-or-Nicd-or-NiMH-Battery-p-1480536.html?p=CA03112038011201508Q">HOTA D6 Pro</a>, a battery charger with all the features needed in the RC world that has also a lot of aspects pointing to increase safety.</p>
