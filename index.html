The BNF version offers only FrSky receivers (ideal if you have a Taranis transmitter): in fact, you can choose between FrSky R-XSR and Frsky XM+ receiver. Otherwise, you can choose the PNP version (without receiver) so you can equip the iFlight Nazgul5 with your preferred receiver (for example, if you have a FlySky transmitter you can use the <a href="http://bit.ly/2N1Qnye">Flysky X6B 2.4G 6CH i-BUS PPM PWM Receiver for AFHDS</a>, which is very good).</p>

<p>Since in my case the transmitter is the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PFdqPK">Flysky FS-i6X</a>, in this article we will take a look at the version mounting a receiver compatible with Flysky AFHDS-2A protocol, which is the Flysky Flit10.</p>

        <p>In this article we will see how to add an FPV camera system to the Syma X5C.<br />
<a href="http://bit.ly/2MZucsj">Syma X5C</a> is a really basic RTF brushed quadcopter which comes with a 2MP camera that can take photos and record videos storing them on the 2GB SD card included in the package. Everything is powered up by a 3.7V 500mAh LiPo battery which guarantees 6-7 minutes of flight depending on flight style and camera usage.</p>

        <p>In this article we will see how to solve the yaw wobbling on the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PIOtUS">Eachine Wizard X220S</a>, which is visible and relevant especially during hovering. By doing this we will see how to analyze flight logs using Betaflight Blackbox Explorer.</p>

        <p>In the <a href="https://upinthesky.github.io/2017/10/23/eachine-wizard-x220s-arf-overview-and-receiver-installation.html">previous article</a> we have seen an overview of the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PIOtUS">Eachine Wizard X220S</a> and how to install the <a href="http://bit.ly/2N1Qnye">FlySky X6B</a> receiver on it (if you have the RTF version I highly suggest to switch to this receiver due to its long range reception capability).
Now we take a look at the setup and configuration of the quadcopter in Betaflight Configurator.</p>

        </h2>
        
        <p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/2PIOtUS">Eachine Wizard X220S</a> is a 220mm FPV Racing/Freestyle quadcopter and it is the evolution of the X220; it comes both in RTF (Ready To Fly) and ARF (Almost Ready to Fly) version.
If you already have a decent transmitter, you can just go for the ARF version and buy a receiver that uses the same protocol as the TX: this is exactly what we are going to see in this article.</p>

        <p>In this article I will show the build of a quadcopter made with a 450 frame kit using APM 2.6 with ArduCopter firmware version 3.2.1 as controller: this system performs attitude control and can be programmed for the execution of autonomous missions using PC (via Mission Planner software) or Smartphone (via DroidPlanner app).</p>
