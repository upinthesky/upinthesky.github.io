        <p>A common problem with the <a href="http://bit.ly/2PIOtUS">Eachine Wizard X220S</a> is the pretty strong video signal noise observable when motors are spinning: as the throttle value goes up, video signal noise (appearing as horizontal lines on the FPV screen) increases. In this article we will see how to remove this annoying behavior with a simple modification.</p>

        <p>RSSI means Received Signal Strength Indication and it is a value that indicates the power in a received radio signal.

If you already have a decent transmitter, you can just go for the ARF version and buy a receiver that uses the same protocol as the TX: this is exactly what we are going to see in this article.</p>
