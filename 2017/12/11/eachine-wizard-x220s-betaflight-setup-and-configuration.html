      <p>In the <a href="https://upinthesky.github.io/2017/10/23/eachine-wizard-x220s-arf-overview-and-receiver-installation.html">previous article</a> we have seen an overview of the <a href="http://bit.ly/2weMZIZ">Eachine Wizard X220S</a> and how to install the FlySky X6B receiver on it.
Now we take a look at the setup and configuration of the quadcopter in Betaflight Configurator.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Betaflight Configurator is a really popular application that allows to configure the aircraft via GUI and it can be downloaded as an extension for Google Chrome browser. Both flight controller and GUI application are <a href="https://github.com/betaflight">open source</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/betaflight_app.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/betaflight_app.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Once the application is correctly installed, it is possible to launch it. Then, it is just a matter of connecting the quadcopter to the PC using a micro USB (Flight Controller) to USB (PC) cable and clicking on “Connect” to establish the connection.</p>

<p><strong>Ports</strong></p>

<p>First, we need to correctly setup the ports on the FC in the “Ports” tab: since we are using FlySky X6B with i-BUS protocol we have to enable “Serial RX” on UART1, which is the port we have soldered receiver cables on:</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/ports.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/ports.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>

<p>In the “Configuration” tab we need to be sure DSHOT600 is selected and we can deactivate “MOTOR_STOP” switch (personal preference):</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_1.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Under “Receiver” we have to set Serial-based receiver (SPEKSAT,…) with “IBUS” selected in the drop down menu:</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_2.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Under “Other Features” it is important (we see how much in the next post) to activate BLACKBOX and SDCARD since these are critical to have flight logs for post flight analysis, especially during the tuning phase when it is possible to use an SD card: class 10 is recommended, while the space required is not important since it will be used to store text files (2 GB is more than enough).</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_3.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_3.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Also OSD (On Screen Display) has to be activated to keep track of useful information on the FPV screen or goggles during the flight.</p>

<p>We can enable VBAT to have battery voltage monitoring (remember we have also connected VBAT output from FC to the receiver to have telemetry on the transmitter) which is a must especially when flying in FPV so we can check on our monitor/goggles the current battery voltage through OSD.</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_4.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/configuration_4.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Failsafe</strong></p>

<p>To configure the failsafe we need to access to an advanced configuration menu which can be activated by clicking on “Enable Expert Mode” like shown in the image below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/failsafe.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/failsafe.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It is recommended to set Failsafe Stage 2 to “Drop”, so if the receiver loses contact with the transmitter for more than a certain time, then the FC turns off the motors. In my case the guard time is 10*0.1s = 1s.</p>

<p><strong>Receiver</strong></p>

<p>In the “Receiver” tab we have to make sure the values of the channels are configured properly in such a way when radio sticks are centered, the value is ~1500, while the minimum and maximum valure are equal respectively to ~1000 and ~2000. This can be achieved configuring trims on the radio.
Set also Stick Min to 1010 and Stick Max to 1990.</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/receiver.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/receiver.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Modes</strong></p>

<p>For the “Modes” tab, we can set the switches on the radio to arm the quadcopter or change from a flight mode to another one or to enable the buzzer for example. In the next figure are reported my settings (Arm, Angle, Horizon, Air Mode, Beeper):</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/modes_1.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/modes_1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/modes_2.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/modes_2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In this way channel AUX 2, a three position switch, controls the flight modes, AUX 3 arms the quadcopter and AUX 4 activates the beeper.</p>

<p>Since I am using Devo 7E with 3 position switch mod, I will report the steps to configure the switches for this particular radio (instructions below are for the three position switch to change between three flight modes and can be replicated for other features, like arming the quadcopter, on two position switches as well).<br />
In Model Menu go on Mixer and set Ch6 to Complex with 3 Mixers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on Page 1 set Switch “SW B0”, Mux “replace”, Curve “Fixed”, Scale “-100”;</li>
  <li>on Page 2 set Switch “SW B1”, Mux “replace”, Curve “Fixed”, Scale “0”;</li>
  <li>on Page 3 set Switch “SW B2”, Mux “replace”, Curve “Fixed”, Scale “100”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OSD</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we can setup the OSD in the way we like, for example, with the following indicators: RSSI, Main Batt Voltage, Crosshairs, Flytime, Flymode.</p>

<p><a href="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/osd.png"><img src="/images/eachine_wizard_x220s_betaflight_setup_and_configuration/osd.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Once we have checked that everything fits well on our FPV goggles or screen, we are ready to fly.</p>
